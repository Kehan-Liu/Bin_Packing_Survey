## Repository Structure
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the algorithms.
- `data/`: Contains the data generator `generate.py` and the data files.
- `eval/`: Contains the evaluation scripts and the results.

## How to Run the Code
- run `make gen` to generate the data.
- run `make eval` to evaluate the algorithms.
- run `make plot` to plot the results. The plots will be saved in the `eval/` directory.
- run `make clean` to clean the generated data and results.
